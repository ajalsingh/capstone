abstract = {Traffic congestion is increasing globally, and this problem needs to be addressed by the traffic management system. Traffic signal control (TSC) is an effective method among various traffic management systems. In a dynamically changing and interconnected traffic environment, the currently model-based TSCs are not adaptive. In addition, with the rise of smart cities and IoT, there is a need for efficient TSCs that can handle large and complex data. To address this issue, this study proposes a TSC system to maximize the number of vehicles crossing an intersection and balances the signals between roads by using Q-learning (QL). The proposed system has a flexible structure that can be modified to suit the changes in the original structure of the intersection.}

abstract={Reinforcement learning with appropriately designed reward signal could be used to solve many sequential learning problems. However, in practice, the reinforcement learning algorithms could be broken in unexpected, counterintuitive ways. One of the failure modes is reward hacking which usually happens when a reward function makes the agent obtain high return in an unexpected way. This unexpected way may subvert the designer’s intentions and lead to accidents during training. In this paper, a new multi-step state-action value algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of reward hacking. Unlike traditional algorithms, the proposed method uses a new return function, which alters the discount of future rewards and no longer stresses the immediate reward as the main influence when selecting the current state action. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two games, Mappy and Mountain Car. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method can alleviate the negative impact of reward hacking and greatly improve the performance of reinforcement learning algorithm. Moreover, the results illustrate that the proposed method could also be applied to the continuous state space problem successfully.},

abstract = "In this paper a multiple classifier machine learning methodology for Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is presented. PdM is a prominent strategy for dealing with maintenance issues given the increasing need to minimize downtime and associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is generating so called {\textquoteright}health factors{\textquoteright} or quantitative indicators of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classification modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance trade-offs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime and then employing this information in an operating cost based maintenance decision system to minimise expected costs. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated using a simulated example and a benchmark semiconductor manufacturing maintenance problem.",

Despite growing interest and practical use, there has been little exploration of the statistical properties of random forests, and little is known about the mathematical forces driving the algorithm. In this paper, we offer an in-depth analysis of a random forests model suggested by Breiman (2004), which is very close to the original algorithm. We show in particular that the procedure is consistent and adapts to sparsity, in the sense that its rate of convergence depends only on the number of strong features and not on how many noise variables are present.},
