Artificial Intelligence (AI) and specifically Machine Learning (ML) is becoming more prominent 
throughout various applications. Thanks to recent innovations in IoT and Big Data, AI/ML systems
are becoming increasingly complex in high-risk scenarios such as smart cities, healthcare and cybersecurity.
However, AI/ML has been proven as troublesome in numerous applications and calls into 
question the reliability of AI.
    
Machine Leaning is a broad area of interest and has multiple branches, including supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.
Each branch has many factors which could affect the reliability of a model.

This report is focused on the development and impacts of bias within datasets and the intended deployment environment in supervised learning models.
Also discussed is the issue of model misspecification, where inappropriate algorithms/methods are utilised hence preventing
robustness and failing to meet intended outcomes. 
Finally, reward hacking is a problematic phenomenon native to Reinforcement Learning systems. 
Here the agent exploits its reward function to achieve maximum reward without accomplishing the intended task.
This report aims to not only determine how aforementioned reliability issues arise in AI/ML, but also propose
various recommendations on ways to mitigate them.
